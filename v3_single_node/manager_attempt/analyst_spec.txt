Okay, here's the software specification based on the implied problem (likely matrix multiplication verification) and then the verification report as requested.

## Software Specification: Matrix Multiplication Verification Tool

This tool verifies the correctness of a matrix multiplication implementation against a known-correct reference implementation.

*   **Purpose:** Validate HPC matrix multiplication routines.
*   **Input:** Two matrices (A, B) and the result matrix (C) from the implementation under test. All matrices are square and of the same dimension.
*   **Reference Implementation:** Utilize a highly optimized BLAS library (e.g., OpenBLAS, MKL) for a gold-standard matrix multiplication.
*   **Verification Metric:** Normalized Frobenius norm of the difference between the test result (C) and the reference result.
*   **Error Threshold:** 1e-6.
*   **Matrix Sizes:** Support verification for matrix sizes 32x32 up to 2048x2048, powers of 2.
*   **Output:**  "Pass" or "Fail" for each tested matrix size, along with the calculated normalized Frobenius norm error.
*   **Data Types:** Support double-precision floating-point (double).
*   **Reporting:** Generate a concise report listing matrix size and verification status.
*   **Platform:** Designed for Linux-based HPC systems.
