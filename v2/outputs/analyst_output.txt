The function should take an integer as input and return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to that number.

Example: Input: 10, Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

Here's a spec for the Fibonacci function:

* Initialize an empty list to store the Fibonacci sequence.
* Set the first two numbers in the list to 0 and 1.
* Create a loop that continues until the next number in the sequence would exceed the input number.
* In each iteration of the loop, calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the last two
